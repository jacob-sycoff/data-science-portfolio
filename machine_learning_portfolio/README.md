# **Machine Learning Portfolio**


## **Project 1: MNIST Digit Classification**
  In this project, I implement a handwritten digit classifier using various simple Machine Learning algorithms including KNN, linear regression, and several Naive Bayes models.


## **Project 2: Topic Classification**
  In this project, I use text data from internet posts to classify a post by topic.


## **Project 3: Poisonous Mushroom Investigation**
In this project, I investigate mushroom properties to determine whether they are poisonous. 
I use PCA, KMeans, and Gaussian Mixture Models. I gain an understanding of the properties that are associated with being poisonous, and predict whether a mushroom is poisonous. The best model had an Accuracy of 97.33.
