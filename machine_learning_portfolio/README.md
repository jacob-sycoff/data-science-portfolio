## **Poisonous Mushroom Investigation**
In this project, I investigate mushroom properties to determine whether they are poisonous. 
I use PCA, KMeans, and Gaussian Mixture Models. I gain an understanding of the properties that are associated with being poisonous, and predict whether a mushroom is poisonous. The best model had an Accuracy of 97.33.
